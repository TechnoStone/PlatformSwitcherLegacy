# PlatformSwitcherLegacy
GTA V Platform Switcher. Was one of my first attempts to code, meant just to work as it is, so nothing fancy here. Can be downloaded from [here](https://gta5-mods.com/tools/grand-theft-auto-v-platform-switcher)

A tiny utility for easy switching between Rockstar Games Launcher, Steam, Epic Games Launcher with just only one game installation.\n
You don't have to install this pretty big game for each launcher and consume so much disk space by duplicating game files.\n
You can just manage all launcher editions by using one game installation and just switching platform-specific files. It saves so much time you'd spend by downloading and fighting stupid issues.\n

## Before usage
Populate each Switcher/*Platform* with all .exe files (`GTA5`, `PlayGTAV`, `GTAVLauncher`, `GTAVLanguageSelect`) and `title.rgl` file
